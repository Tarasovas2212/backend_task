## Project Structure

The project consists of two main directories:

- **client**: This directory contains the frontend (client-side) code.
- **server**: This directory contains the backend (server-side) code.

## Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:

cd client
npm install

## Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

cd server
npm install

## Running the Client

To run the client-side application, execute the following command in the client directory:

### `npm start`

This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The server will listen on http://localhost:3000.

## Running the Server

To run the server-side application, execute the following command in the server directory:

### `npm run dev`

This command will start the server using a development environment. The server will listen on http://localhost:5000.
